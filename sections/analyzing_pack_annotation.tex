\p For the purposes of conceptualization, we are going to borrow and admittedly abuse some of the mathematical notation available for formulations, mixed with the annotators $\mathlarger{\bm{\{\}[]}}$ that we are going to use when we translate this into the proposed C++ syntax for annotation.
A C++ template parameter pack $...T$ will be symbolized as a capital letter with an overline (i.e. $\overline{T}$), while the $\bm{sizeof...(T)}$ constant expression will be symbolized as $|\overline{T}|$.

\p Unless otherwise specified, all other notation used in the following formulation refers to its pristine mathematical meaning.
At the current stage of this incomplete draft, there may be unintentional discrepancies that have to be corrected and will be in a newer version of this draft.
