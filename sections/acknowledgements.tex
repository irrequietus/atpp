The author would like to thank Ville Voutilainen, current secretary of the C++ standard committee for strongly motivating me to write this initial draft.
Fixed size parameter packs were discussed and presented on the C++ std-proposals mailing\cite{Bos2014} list, in a thread started by Maurice Bos.
The initial draft release was revision {\color{magenta}{7d4fb49}}\cite{Mak2014b}. Gerhard RÃ¶thlin privately provided feedback for
paragraph {\color{magenta}{7d4fb49/63}} pinpointing an obvious error in a constant expression (fixed).
