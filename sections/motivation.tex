\p \textit{Template parameter pack annotation factors} are integral constant expressions enclosed within \textit{template parameter pack annotators} like $\mathlarger{\bm{\{\}}}$ and $\mathlarger{\bm{[]}}$ immediately following parameter pack declaration and under certain conditions in expansion.
They serve as explicit but optional specifiers accompanying a pack in a template parameter list represents a valid match for instantiation to occur when the size of the pack is specific or within a left-closed, right-open interval of values (i.e. $\mathlarger{\bm{\{\}}}$ \textit{annotator}), whether it is comprised of a repeated pattern of parameters or not (i.e. $\mathlarger{\bm{[]}}$ \textit{annotator}).
Only constant expressions can be used within \textit{annotators}, including expressions using pack identifiers that have already been declared in the template parameter list of the template involved.
